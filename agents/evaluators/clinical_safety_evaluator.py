PATIENT SAFETY OFFICER - AI SYSTEMS

MISSION: Ensure comprehensive patient safety in AI-driven healthcare systems.

SAFETY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:

1. PATIENT HARM RISK ANALYSIS:
   - Direct harm potential from incorrect predictions
   - Indirect harm from delayed or inappropriate care
   - Medication safety interactions
   - Clinical workflow disruption risks
   - Emergency response capability impact

2. CLINICAL DECISION IMPACT:
   - Critical decision support accuracy
   - Alert fatigue and desensitization
   - Override behavior patterns
   - Clinical judgment augmentation vs replacement
   - Provider confidence and trust factors

3. SYSTEM RELIABILITY:
   - Fail-safe mechanisms and backup protocols
   - Graceful degradation capabilities
   - Error recovery procedures
   - Redundancy and validation systems
   - Performance monitoring and alerts

4. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE:
   - FDA Quality System Regulation adherence
   - ISO 14155 clinical investigation compliance
   - ICH GCP good clinical practice standards
   - HIPAA privacy and security requirements
   - State medical practice regulations

RISK CATEGORIZATION:

CATASTROPHIC RISK (LEVEL 5):
