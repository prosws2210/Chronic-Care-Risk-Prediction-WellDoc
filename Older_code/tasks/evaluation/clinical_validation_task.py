        patient safety, and adherence to established clinical guidelines for chronic care management.
        
        **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:**
        Validate that AI model predictions align with clinical expertise, established medical 
        guidelines, and evidence-based practice while ensuring patient safety and care quality.
