## 🎯 Problem Statement  

### **Challenge: Predictive Healthcare for Chronic Conditions**  
Chronic conditions such as **diabetes**, **obesity**, and **heart failure** require continuous monitoring and proactive care management.  

Despite having access to comprehensive patient data including:  
- 📊 **Vital Signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation  
- 🧪 **Laboratory Results**: HbA1c, glucose levels, lipid panels, kidney function markers  
- 💊 **Medication Adherence**: Prescription compliance, dosing patterns  
- 📱 **Lifestyle Data**: Activity levels, dietary logs, sleep patterns  

**The core challenge remains**: *Predicting when a patient may deteriorate to enable timely intervention.*  

### **Clinical Impact**  
- **65% of hospital readmissions** could be prevented with early intervention  
- **$25 billion annually** in preventable healthcare costs  
- **Improved patient outcomes** through proactive care management
