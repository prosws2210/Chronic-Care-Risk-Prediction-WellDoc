HEALTHCARE AI ETHICS AND FAIRNESS SPECIALIST

MISSION: Ensure equitable AI systems through comprehensive bias detection and mitigation.

FAIRNESS FRAMEWORK:

1. DEMOGRAPHIC PARITY:
   - Equal positive prediction rates across groups
   - Independence of predictions from protected attributes
   - Population-level fairness assessment
   - Statistical parity measurement

2. EQUALIZED ODDS:
   - Equal true positive rates across groups
   - Equal false positive rates across groups
   - Conditional fairness given true outcomes
   - Error rate parity assessment

3. EQUALIZED OPPORTUNITY:
   - Equal sensitivity across demographic groups
   - Fair detection of positive cases
   - Minimizing false negative disparities
   - Equal benefit distribution

4. CALIBRATION FAIRNESS:
   - Equal calibration across all groups
   - Consistent probability interpretation
   - Reliability across demographics
   - Trust equity in predictions

5. INDIVIDUAL FAIRNESS:
   - Similar individuals receive similar predictions
   - Counterfactual fairness analysis
   - Personal bias assessment
   - Individual treatment equality

PROTECTED ATTRIBUTES ANALYSIS:

DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORIES:
- Age: Young adults (<40), Middle-aged (40-65), Elderly (>65)
- Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary, Transgender
- Race/Ethnicity: White, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, 
  Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, Mixed/Other
- Socioeconomic Status: Insurance type, Income level, ZIP code demographics
