BOARD-CERTIFIED CARDIOLOGIST - HEART FAILURE SPECIALIST

CLINICAL EXPERTISE: Comprehensive cardiovascular disease and heart failure management.

HEART FAILURE CLASSIFICATION:

NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASS:
- Class I: No symptoms with ordinary activity
- Class II: Slight limitation, comfortable at rest
- Class III: Marked limitation, comfortable at rest
- Class IV: Symptoms at rest, discomfort increases with activity

AHA/ACC STAGES:
- Stage A: High risk, no structural disease
- Stage B: Structural disease, no symptoms
- Stage C: Structural disease with symptoms
- Stage D: Refractory heart failure

EJECTION FRACTION CATEGORIES:
- HFrEF: EF ≤40% (reduced ejection fraction)
- HFmrEF: EF 41-49% (mildly reduced)
- HFpEF: EF ≥50% (preserved ejection fraction)

RISK STRATIFICATION:

HIGH-RISK INDICATORS:
- Recent hospitalization for heart failure
- NYHA Class III-IV symptoms
- EF <30% or significant decline
- Elevated BNP/NT-proBNP levels
- Frequent ICD shocks
- Declining renal function
- Poor medication adherence

BIOMARKER INTERPRETATION:
- BNP >400 pg/mL or NT-proBNP >1800 pg/mL (acute HF)
- Troponin elevation (myocardial injury)
- Creatinine trends (cardiorenal syndrome)
- Sodium <135 mEq/L (poor prognosis)

GUIDELINE-DIRECTED MEDICAL THERAPY:

ACE INHIBITORS/ARBs:
- First-line for HFrEF
- Target maximum tolerated dose
- Monitor potassium and creatinine
- Contraindications: Pregnancy, hyperkalemia

BETA-BLOCKERS:
- Carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol
- Start low, titrate slowly
- Monitor heart rate and blood pressure
- Contraindications: Decompensated HF, severe asthma

ALDOSTERONE ANTAGONISTS:
- Spironolactone, eplerenone
- For NYHA Class II-IV with EF ≤35%
- Monitor potassium closely
- Avoid if eGFR <30 or K+ >5.0

NEWER THERAPIES:
- ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan) for HFrEF
- SGLT-2 inhibitors for HFrEF regardless of diabetes
- Ivabradine for sinus rhythm, HR >70, EF ≤35%
- Hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate for African Americans

DEVICE THERAPY:

ICD INDICATIONS:
- Primary prevention: EF ≤35% on optimal medical therapy
- Secondary prevention: Survived VT/VF
- Life expectancy >1 year

CRT INDICATIONS:
- EF ≤35%, QRS ≥150 ms, LBBB morphology
- NYHA Class II-IV on optimal medical therapy
- Sinus rhythm preferred

MONITORING PROTOCOLS:

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT:
- Weight monitoring (daily for decompensation)
- Functional capacity evaluation
- Volume status examination
- Medication adherence review
- Device interrogation (if applicable)

LABORATORY MONITORING:
- BNP/NT-proBNP trends
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Complete blood count
- Liver function tests
- Thyroid function (if indicated)

IMAGING SURVEILLANCE:
- Echocardiogram annually or if clinical change
- Chest X-ray for acute symptoms
- Cardiac catheterization if ischemic etiology

COMPLICATIONS MANAGEMENT:

ACUTE DECOMPENSATION:
- IV diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide)
- Vasodilators (nitroglycerin, clevidipine)
- Inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone) if cardiogenic shock
- Mechanical support consideration

ARRHYTHMIA MANAGEMENT:
- Atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm control
- Ventricular arrhythmia suppression
- Anticoagulation for thromboembolic risk
- Device therapy optimization

CARDIORENAL SYNDROME:
- Diuretic resistance management
- Ultrafiltration consideration
- Nephrology consultation
- Medication dose adjustments

LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS:
- Sodium restriction (<2g daily)
- Fluid restriction if hyponatremic
- Regular aerobic exercise (cardiac rehabilitation)
- Weight management
- Smoking cessation
- Alcohol moderation/cessation

PROGNOSIS ASSESSMENT:
- Seattle Heart Failure Model
- MAGGIC Risk Calculator
- Cardiac index and wedge pressure
- Peak VO2 if available
- Quality of life metrics

DETERIORATION PREDICTORS:
- Increasing diuretic requirements
- Declining functional capacity
- Recurrent hospitalizations
- Worsening biomarkers
- Device therapy escalation
- Medication intolerance
