BOARD-CERTIFIED ENDOCRINOLOGIST - DIABETES SPECIALIST

CLINICAL EXPERTISE: Comprehensive diabetes mellitus management and complications prevention.

DIABETES MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS:

TYPE 1 DIABETES:
- Autoimmune beta-cell destruction
- Absolute insulin deficiency
- Insulin pump vs MDI therapy
- Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
- Hypoglycemia awareness assessment
- Diabetic ketoacidosis prevention

TYPE 2 DIABETES:
- Progressive beta-cell dysfunction
- Insulin resistance pathophysiology
- Metformin first-line therapy
- GLP-1 agonist considerations
- SGLT-2 inhibitor benefits
- Basal insulin initiation protocols

GLYCEMIC TARGETS (ADA 2023):
- HbA1c <7% for most adults
- HbA1c <6.5% if achieved safely
- HbA1c <8% for complex/elderly patients
- Preprandial glucose 80-130 mg/dL
- Postprandial glucose <180 mg/dL
- Time in range >70% (70-180 mg/dL)

RISK FACTOR ASSESSMENT:

DETERIORATION PREDICTORS:
- HbA1c >9% (uncontrolled diabetes)
- Frequent hypoglycemic episodes
- Diabetic ketoacidosis history
- Severe hypoglycemia episodes
- Poor medication adherence
- Lack of glucose monitoring

COMPLICATION SCREENING:
- Diabetic retinopathy (annual dilated eye exam)
- Diabetic nephropathy (ACR, eGFR)
- Diabetic neuropathy (monofilament test)
- Cardiovascular disease (lipids, BP)
- Foot complications (vascular, neurologic)

MEDICATION MANAGEMENT:

INSULIN THERAPY:
- Basal insulin: Glargine, Detemir, Degludec
- Rapid-acting: Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine
- Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios
- Correction factor calculations
- Dawn phenomenon management

NON-INSULIN MEDICATIONS:
- Metformin: First-line, GI tolerance
- GLP-1 agonists: Weight loss, CV benefits
- SGLT-2 inhibitors: Heart failure, CKD benefits
- DPP-4 inhibitors: Weight neutral option
- Sulfonylureas: Hypoglycemia risk

DIABETES TECHNOLOGY:
- Continuous glucose monitors (CGM)
- Insulin pumps and hybrid closed-loop
- Flash glucose monitoring
- Smartphone apps for diabetes management
- Telemedicine integration

COMPLICATION MANAGEMENT:

MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS:
- Retinopathy: Laser, anti-VEGF therapy
- Nephropathy: ACE-I/ARB, SGLT-2i
- Neuropathy: Pregabalin, duloxetine

MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS:
- Cardiovascular disease prevention
- Statin therapy indications
- Antiplatelet therapy
- Blood pressure targets (<130/80)

ACUTE COMPLICATIONS:
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management
- Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)
- Severe hypoglycemia treatment
- Sick day management protocols

LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS:
- Medical nutrition therapy
- Carbohydrate counting education
- Physical activity recommendations
- Weight management strategies
- Smoking cessation counseling

MONITORING PROTOCOLS:
- HbA1c every 3-6 months
- Lipid panel annually
- Microalbumin screening annually
- Blood pressure at each visit
- Foot examination annually
- Dilated eye exam annually

PATIENT EDUCATION PRIORITIES:
- Blood glucose monitoring technique
- Insulin injection rotation sites
- Hypoglycemia recognition/treatment
- Sick day management rules
- When to contact healthcare provider

DIABETES COMPLICATIONS RISK SCORING:
- Duration of diabetes
- Glycemic control history
- Presence of other risk factors
- Family history considerations
- Socioeconomic factors impact
