OBESITY MEDICINE SPECIALIST

CLINICAL EXPERTISE: Comprehensive obesity management and metabolic health optimization.

OBESITY CLASSIFICATION:

BMI CATEGORIES:
- Normal weight: 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
- Overweight: 25.0-29.9 kg/m²
- Class I Obesity: 30.0-34.9 kg/m²
- Class II Obesity: 35.0-39.9 kg/m²
- Class III Obesity: ≥40 kg/m² (severe obesity)

WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE RISK:
- Men: >40 inches (102 cm)
- Women: >35 inches (88 cm)
- Indicator of visceral adiposity and metabolic risk

BODY FAT PERCENTAGE:
- Men: >25% (overfat), >30% (obese)
- Women: >32% (overfat), >38% (obese)

METABOLIC SYNDROME CRITERIA:

REQUIRES 3 OF 5 COMPONENTS:
1. Abdominal obesity (waist circumference criteria)
2. Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL
3. HDL-C <40 mg/dL (men), <50 mg/dL (women)
4. Blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg
5. Fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL

OBESITY-RELATED COMORBIDITIES:

CARDIOVASCULAR:
- Hypertension (75% of obese patients)
- Dyslipidemia (atherogenic profile)
- Coronary artery disease
- Heart failure
- Atrial fibrillation

METABOLIC:
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Insulin resistance
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
- Metabolic dysfunction

RESPIRATORY:
- Obstructive sleep apnea
- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
- Asthma exacerbation
- Pulmonary embolism risk

MECHANICAL/MUSCULOSKELETAL:
- Osteoarthritis (weight-bearing joints)
- Low back pain
- Mobility impairment
- Increased fall risk

GASTROINTESTINAL:
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Gallbladder disease
- Hernias
- Colon cancer risk

TREATMENT APPROACHES:

LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS:
- Comprehensive lifestyle intervention (CLI)
- Caloric deficit 500-750 kcal/day
- Mediterranean or DASH diet patterns
- Physical activity: 150-300 min/week moderate intensity
- Behavioral counseling and support groups

PHARMACOTHERAPY:

FDA-APPROVED ANTI-OBESITY MEDICATIONS:
- Orlistat: Lipase inhibitor, 5-10% weight loss
- Phentermine/Topiramate ER: 10-15% weight loss
- Naltrexone/Bupropion ER: 5-10% weight loss
- Liraglutide 3.0 mg: 8-12% weight loss
- Semaglutide 2.4 mg: 15-20% weight loss

MEDICATION SELECTION CRITERIA:
- BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with comorbidities
- Previous weight loss attempts
- Contraindications assessment
- Cost and insurance coverage
- Patient preference and lifestyle

BARIATRIC SURGERY:

INDICATIONS:
- BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 with significant comorbidities
- Failed non-surgical approaches
- Psychological readiness
- Commitment to lifestyle changes
- Acceptable surgical risk

PROCEDURES:
- Sleeve gastrectomy (most common)
- Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
- Adjustable gastric band
- Duodenal switch (complex cases)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- 20-30% total body weight loss
- Diabetes remission: 60-80%
- Hypertension improvement: 70%
- Sleep apnea resolution: 80-90%

RISK STRATIFICATION:

HIGH-RISK INDICATORS:
- BMI >40 with multiple comorbidities
- Rapid weight gain (>10 lbs/year)
- Central obesity with metabolic syndrome
- Sleep apnea with hypoxemia
- Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c >9%)
- Heart failure with preserved EF

DETERIORATION PREDICTORS:
- Progressive weight gain despite intervention
- Worsening glycemic control
- Increasing blood pressure requirements
- New or worsening sleep apnea
- Mobility decline
- Depression or eating disorders

MONITORING PROTOCOLS:

ANTHROPOMETRIC:
- Weight and BMI monthly initially
- Waist circumference quarterly
- Body composition if available

METABOLIC PARAMETERS:
- Fasting glucose and HbA1c
- Lipid panel every 6-12 months
- Liver function tests
- Vitamin deficiencies (especially post-bariatric)

COMORBIDITY SCREENING:
- Sleep study if indicated
- Echocardiogram for heart failure risk
- Liver ultrasound for NAFLD
- Bone density (post-menopausal women)

BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT:
- Eating behavior patterns
- Physical activity levels
- Psychological well-being
- Social support systems
- Medication adherence

TREATMENT GOALS:
- 5-10% weight loss (clinically meaningful)
- Improvement in obesity-related comorbidities
- Enhanced quality of life
- Sustainable lifestyle changes
- Long-term weight maintenance

COMPLICATIONS PREVENTION:
- Diabetes prevention/management
- Cardiovascular risk reduction
- Sleep apnea treatment
- Joint protection strategies
- Mental health support
