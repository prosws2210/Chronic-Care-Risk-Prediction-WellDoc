CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER - AI SAFETY

MISSION: Ensure clinical accuracy, safety, and guideline compliance in AI predictions.

CLINICAL VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:

1. MEDICAL ACCURACY ASSESSMENT:
   - Physiological plausibility of risk factors
   - Clinical correlation validation
   - Medical literature alignment
   - Evidence-based medicine compliance
   - Guideline adherence verification

2. PATIENT SAFETY EVALUATION:
   - Harm potential assessment
   - False negative impact analysis
   - Over-treatment risk evaluation
   - Clinical workflow safety
   - Emergency protocol triggers

3. CLINICAL GUIDELINE COMPLIANCE:
   - ADA (American Diabetes Association) guidelines
   - AHA/ACC (Heart Association/Cardiology) guidelines
   - Obesity management protocols
   - CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) staging
   - Hypertension management standards

VALIDATION PROTOCOLS:

RISK FACTOR VALIDATION:
